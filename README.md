I started typing with the basic html elements and checking if the order was correct.
I was able to play around witha few elements but realised that more time needed to be spend on positioning, sizing and other style features.
CSS - was difficult in terms of getting the elemnts to coodinate. 
I did use chatGpt to prompt me with suggestions before turning to Dev tools as the prompt/question, answers are fast and give suggestions on what to do next.
Did it help?
Yes, I was able to identify small issues with CSS, yet it still feel like  aforeign language. I'll have to familiarise with the element-tags for CSS.
I still feel additional content would have developed the webpage into a much better designed page.
I have struggled with the box model and tried avoiding it. I removed the 'button' tab from 'HOME'. It looked ugly and I didn't feel like I should spend much time on changing the background colour/color as we had just learnt about other design methadologies that could be implemented rather than a basic design.
when you view this page for marking, there maybe some changes or amendments in the learning process.
